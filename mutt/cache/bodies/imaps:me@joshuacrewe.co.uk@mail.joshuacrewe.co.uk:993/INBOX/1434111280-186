Hi Guys - We have got our new car, hurray (it is really good but red)! Hope
you had a good time in Plymouth & everyone's well.

Have you sorted out your plan re the week/weekend after next?

Just to let you know that we have said to our insurers to stop our
insurance cover on the Fabia starting from 13th Dec. We thought we could
officially sign everything over to you on the Saturday 12th Dec (or when
you arrive?).

We are happy for you to have it for nothing to drive away but reckon a
mates rate of about =C2=A31500 is fair if that is ok with you (happy to red=
uce).
You can pay us whenever it suits you & do it in installments or however you
want.

John has just been through sorting out the tax & insurance for us so this
is the info that we think you need. Don't do Tax until 1st Dec & insurance
from 12th (or earlier if you want to drive it whilst here). For insurance
you probably need most of this, for tax just 1st & last reg & ref nos:
- Reg No: GF07 UXT, date of 1st reg is 26/04/2007
- Make: Skoda
- Model: Fabia Classic 12V HTP
- Body Type: Estate
- Petrol, 1198cc
- Current Reg Keeper: John Fitzpatrick
- Mileage: 79,843
- Ref No on V5C/2 is 320658479077

It has an MOT up to 17th Feb 2016 & was serviced last month. Think that
covers it! Love you lots & can't wait to see you, xxxxx

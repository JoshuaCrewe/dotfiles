<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I said I would email you. I have built a fairly bespoke custom email writing environment. Wanna see?</p>

<p>I am not 100% sure that that image will attach or even send properly. Do let me know as I am keen to debug this setup.</p>
<p>Aaaaaanyway I said I would send y’all an email. I presume that both of you will be able to read this or do you have separate email addresses?</p>
<p>I came from your website and I would like to say that I really like it.<br />
I remember you saying that liked it but you thought it was a little slow? If you wanted help we could help a bit. I know that there is one quick incremental gain you could make which is your twitter logo in the footer is 1140x927 and fitting in a space of 30x24 . You could update that image with a smaller one closer to the size it needs to be on the website. Also those links don’t work on Firefox.</p>

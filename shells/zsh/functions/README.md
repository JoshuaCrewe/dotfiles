# Functions

Here is a reference for all the functions which I have shamelessly coppied off the internet from other peoples dotfiles. The one exception is the `fox` command which was adapted from `c`. It doesn't work very well as the Firefox user folder is hard coded and different for each machine.

* `take` - Makes a directory and changes to it. 
* `cdls` - Changes to a directory and then lists the contents.
* `fox` - Search Firefox history with fzf.
* `fh` - use fzf to search through command line history.
* `tree` - List directories as a tree.
* `<c-z` - Use ctrl+z to suspend and unsuspend vim.
* `zman` - Search zshall manual ( faulty ).
* `fd` - Change to selected directory with fzf.
* `fda` - Including hidden files.
* `fbr` - Checkout Git branch with fzf.
* `fco` - Checkout Git Branch or tag with fzf.
* `fshow` - Git commit browser with fzf.
* `ftags` - Search ctags with fzf.
* `fs` - Switch tmux sessions with fzf.
* `c` - Search Chrome history with fzf.
* `man` - Get some colour in man pages.
